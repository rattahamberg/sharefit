# Project Description

This project is a full-stack outfit sharing web application built for CS 110 (Web Development Principles). It allows users to:
Create an account and manage a personal profile
Post outfits with images and descriptions
Browse a feed of outfits created by other users
View individual outfit pages with details and engagement
Like/rate and comment on outfits to provide feedback

The application is implemented with a React + Vite frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, using MongoDB Atlas for persistent data storage. It is designed as a single-page application consuming a RESTful API, with a focus on modular components, clear route structure, and predictable state management.

`cd frontend/sharefit`
